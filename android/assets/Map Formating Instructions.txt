for myself, so I remember them xD

it doesnt matter how many tileLayers you use, because the layer detection is name based

Object Layers:
	
	regular CollisionLayer: must be named "colObs"
		all objects will be collidable (no need for extra propertie or something)
			
	SpecialTilesLayer: must be named "specTiles"
		add property "action" to specify function of the tile, current functions are:
			action-change : changes the map
			changemap-"mapname" : will specify the map to change
			changetile-"0,0" : will specify wich tile the player spawns on
			action-trigger : will trigger something ingame
