for myself, so I remember them xD

it doesnt matter how many tileLayers you use, because the layer detection is name based

Object Layers:
	
	regular CollisionLayer: must be named "colObs"
		all objects will be collidable (no need for extra propertie or something)
			
	SpecialTilesLayer: must be named "specTiles"
		add property "action" to specify function of the tile, current functions are:
			action-door : changes the map
				changemap-"mapname" : will specify the map to change
				changetile-"0,0" : will specify wich tile the player spawns on
			action-trigger : will trigger something ingame
			
	TrainerLayer: must be named trainerTiles
		each object is a spot a trainer will spawn, you need to add a custom property to specify the trainer you want
		texture-"trainername" : set's the trainer's texture to the texture specified
